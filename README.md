Send the Sender.py file to the person who want to chat with the receiver and so like this we can create a group chat with the reciever and so 
reciever can chat with all the senders who are using the file to send the connection to the reciever.
So It Is a Mulit-Chat server for only reciever and in future i will try to make it as for all the sender and recivers in the connections.
To make like a real group chat , but using this file only reciever can chat with all the sender's at the same time.
############################################## WORKING #################################################################################
First of all the Reciever.py is run to make a connection and then the sender file is executed to accept the connection made by the Reciever.py
file and so as many as Sender.py file are there . . the more the connection can be connected to the Reciever.
